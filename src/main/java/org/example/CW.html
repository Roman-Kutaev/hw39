    <h1>Vehicle</h1>
    <br>A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum <span style="color: blue"><sup>[1]</sup></span>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons, <br>
    <br>bicycle, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships,<br>
    <br>boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and <br>
    <br>spacecraft. <span style="color: blue"><sup>[2]</sup></span><br>
    <br>&nbsp;<br>
    <br>Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground:<br>
    <br>wheeled tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for<br>
    <br>road vehicles types, terms and definitions. <span style="color:blue"><sup>[3]</sup></span> <br>
